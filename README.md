# ToiletLocator
iOS Toilet Locator App

Hi, this application was designed in March of 2017 by Spencer Gritton as a test project for iOS development
Thanks for your interest!

This was an extracurricular project that I used to learn the basics of mobile development specifically with Swift. It is optimized for iOS 10.xx and earlier so some display features will be broken if a build is attempted on iOS 11.xx or later.

Originally when I decided that I wanted to build an iOS application I had a difficult time coming up with ideas that I felt would be both challenging and interesting. After my aunt came home from a trip and told me that she had difficulties finding a bathroom I decided that I might as well create a public bathroom locating application. 

The application works by querying apple Maps API for nearby locations that would most likely house a public bathroom (coffee shops, gas stations, etc) then it displays the closest of those locations within 10 miles as well as directions to find those locations if you so choose. Overall is was a fantastic experience and although the design is not the most elegant I'm proud of my work.
